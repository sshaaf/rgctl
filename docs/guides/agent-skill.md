# Agent pack (skills)

## Introduction

The rgctl **agent pack** teaches AI coding agents (Claude Code, Antigravity, Codex, Cursor, …) how to answer structural questions with the rgctl CLI. Install writes **one skill** named `rgctl`:

| Piece | What it is | Example (Cursor, repo-local) |
|-------|------------|------------------------------|
| **Skill `rgctl`** | Single skill + `references/` (command encyclopedia, workflow scenarios) | `.cursor/skills/rgctl/SKILL.md` |
| **Policy snippet** | Optional structural bias | `.cursor/rules/rgctl-structural.mdc` (`--with-policy`) |

The pack is **embedded in the `rgctl` binary**. `rgctl install --skill` installs **one** skill named `rgctl` per adapter — not separate `rgctl-discover` / `rgctl-impact` / … skills. Agents load that skill and run `rgctl -f json` structured verbs. Scenario playbooks live under `references/workflows.md` inside the skill.

## Use Cases

The pack unlocks several workflows where structural graph analysis and AI reasoning combine:

### Refactoring with Confidence

Before renaming, extracting, or restructuring a function, the agent can automatically check the blast radius, trace callers, and verify that no hidden dependencies will break. Instead of manually running commands, you ask the agent a natural-language question and it handles the analysis.

### Monolith-to-Microservice Migration

The agent can generate a complete migration roadmap, explain the ordering rationale, identify high-risk extraction targets, and guide you through each step -- all from conversational prompts like "generate a migration plan for this repo" or "what should we extract first?"

### Porting a Function from One Language to Another

When rewriting a function from Java to Go (or any language pair), the agent can extract the function's data-flow graph, call neighborhood, and field mutations from the source language, then verify that the target-language implementation preserves the same logic and data-flow structure. The graph provides a language-independent ground truth.

### Writing Better Test Cases

The agent can analyze a function's control-flow graph, identify all branch paths, trace data dependencies, and use that structural information to generate test cases that cover the actual code paths rather than guessing at coverage.

### Continuous Architecture Review

With the pack installed, every code review conversation has access to architectural context. The agent can check policy compliance, detect coupling drift, and flag high-impact changes before they are merged.

## Example Project

This guide uses the **CoolStore** (`example/coolstore`). Make sure you have run `discover` first:

CoolStore examples use `-l java` to index the Java backend only (skip Angular/bower).

```bash
rgctl -r example/coolstore discover -l java --with-cfg
```

## Step-by-Step

### 1. Install the pack

Install the `rgctl` skill into your repository:

```bash
rgctl -r example/coolstore install --skill --tools cursor,claude,codex,antigravity,agents
```

Text mode lists each created or updated path. Typical layout (Cursor example):

- `.cursor/skills/rgctl/SKILL.md` — the skill
- `.cursor/skills/rgctl/references/` — command encyclopedia, workflows, communities & policy

**What happened:**

- rgctl unpacked the embedded **agent pack** (generated at build time from `skills/rgctl/`, including `references/workflows.md`).
- **Claude** uses `.claude/skills/`.
- **Codex / agents / zed** share `.agents/skills/` (install dedupes).
- **Cursor** uses `.cursor/skills/`.
- Scenario prose lives in `skills/rgctl/references/workflows.md` and is copied into the installed skill.
- No network — content matches your `rgctl` binary version.

See [Install options reference](#install-options-reference) below for the full flag table and registry (`install --list-agents`).

### 2. Verify with JSON Output

Check the install status programmatically:

```bash
rgctl -r example/coolstore -f json install --skill --tools cursor \
  | jq '{schema_version, scope, agents, writes: [.writes[] | {agent, workflow, kind, status}]}'
```

**Output (schema version 3, abbreviated):**

```json
{
  "schema_version": 3,
  "command": "install",
  "skill": "rgctl",
  "repo": "/path/to/example/coolstore",
  "scope": "local",
  "agents": ["cursor"],
  "with_policy": false,
  "force": false,
  "writes": [
    {
      "agent": "cursor",
      "workflow": null,
      "kind": "meta",
      "path": "/path/to/example/coolstore/.cursor/skills/rgctl/SKILL.md",
      "status": "unchanged"
    }
  ]
}
```

The `status` field for each write is one of:
- `created` -- new file written
- `unchanged` -- file already exists with identical content (idempotent)
- `overwritten` -- existing file replaced (with `--force`)
- `skipped_exists` -- file differs but `--force` was not set (exit code 1)

### 3. Install for specific agents

Limit adapters with **`--tools`** (comma-separated registry ids):

```bash
rgctl -r example/coolstore install --skill --tools claude
rgctl -r example/coolstore install --skill --tools codex,agents
rgctl -r example/coolstore install --skill --tools antigravity
rgctl -r example/coolstore install --skill --tools cursor
rgctl install --list-agents   # all ids and paths
```

**`--host`** is deprecated; it still maps to a subset of tools but prints a warning.

### 4. Update After Upgrading rgctl

When you upgrade rgctl, the embedded skill may have changed. Update it with `--force`:

```bash
rgctl -r example/coolstore install --skill --force
```

This overwrites any existing skill files, even if they have been modified locally.

### 5. The Agent Loop

Once installed, the agent follows a 5-step loop for every structural question:

```
1. USER PROMPT     "What's the impact of changing priceShoppingCart?"
2. TOOL CALL       rgctl -f json blast-radius priceShoppingCart
3. GRAPH FACTS     Parse JSON: score 40.6, 6 callers, impact zone 12
4. LLM REASONING   Summarize: moderate risk, spans service and REST layers
5. ACTION          Report findings, suggest next steps
```

The skill includes a **decision table** that maps 19 categories of natural-language questions to the right rgctl command. The agent does not need to be told which command to use -- it matches the user's intent automatically.

---

## Use Case: Refactoring with Confidence

### Scenario

You want to refactor `priceShoppingCart` in the CoolStore application -- perhaps splitting it into separate pricing methods for items and shipping. Before making changes, you need to understand the full impact.

### What the Agent Does

When you ask the agent: *"What happens if I change priceShoppingCart?"*

The agent follows the skill's decision table (row 10: "Impact if I change X") and runs:

```bash
rgctl -r example/coolstore -f json blast-radius priceShoppingCart
```

**Output:**

```json
{
  "metrics": {
    "score": 40.35,
    "direct_callers_count": 5,
    "impact_zone_size": 7
  },
  "target": {
    "canonical_fqn": "ShoppingCartService::priceShoppingCart",
    "file_path": "src/main/java/com/redhat/coolstore/service/ShoppingCartService.java",
    "signature": "public void priceShoppingCart(ShoppingCart sc) {"
  },
  "topology": {
    "direct_callers": [
      {"fqn": "com.redhat.coolstore.service.ShoppingCartService.checkOutShoppingCart"},
      {"fqn": "com.redhat.coolstore.rest.CartEndpoint.add"},
      {"fqn": "com.redhat.coolstore.rest.CartEndpoint.dedupeCartItems"},
      {"fqn": "com.redhat.coolstore.rest.CartEndpoint.delete"},
      {"fqn": "com.redhat.coolstore.rest.CartEndpoint.set"}
    ]
  }
}
```

The agent then reports:

> priceShoppingCart has a blast-radius score of 40.6/100 (moderate risk). It has 6 direct callers (checkOutShoppingCart, CartEndpoint add/set/delete/dedupeCartItems, and ShoppingCart.addShoppingCartItem). The impact zone is 12 functions. Changing the signature requires updating those callers.

### Going Deeper: Call Neighborhood

The agent can then trace the call neighborhood to understand what `priceShoppingCart` itself depends on:

```bash
rgctl -r example/coolstore -f json cpg calls priceShoppingCart
```

**Output (truncated):**

```json
{
  "edges": [
    {"direction": "out", "name": "initShoppingCartForPricing"},
    {"direction": "out", "name": "getShoppingCartItemList"},
    {"direction": "out", "name": "setCartItemPromoSavings"},
    {"direction": "out", "name": "getCartItemTotal"},
    {"direction": "out", "name": "setCartItemTotal"},
    {"direction": "out", "name": "setShippingTotal"},
    {"direction": "out", "name": "setCartTotal"}
  ]
}
```

The agent reports: *"priceShoppingCart calls 7 functions: it initializes pricing, iterates cart items to compute totals and promo savings, calculates shipping, and sets the final cart total. A refactoring that splits item pricing from shipping pricing should preserve these call relationships."*

### Verifying Field Mutations

Before splitting the function, check which fields it modifies:

```bash
rgctl -r example/coolstore -f json cpg mutations \
  --type ShoppingCart --exclude-ctors
```

**Output:**

```json
{
  "mutations": [
    {"function": "setShoppingCartItemList", "member": "shoppingCartItemList", "line": 35},
    {"function": "setCartItemTotal", "member": "cartItemTotal", "line": 71},
    {"function": "setShippingTotal", "member": "shippingTotal", "line": 79},
    {"function": "setCartTotal", "member": "cartTotal", "line": 87},
    {"function": "setCartItemPromoSavings", "member": "cartItemPromoSavings", "line": 95},
    {"function": "setShippingPromoSavings", "member": "shippingPromoSavings", "line": 103}
  ]
}
```

The agent reports: *"ShoppingCart has 6 mutable fields. The priceShoppingCart method writes to cartItemTotal, shippingTotal, cartTotal, cartItemPromoSavings, and shippingPromoSavings through their setters. If you split the method, ensure both halves still set all required fields."*

---

## Use Case: Migration Planning

### Scenario

You need to decompose the CoolStore application into microservices and want a data-driven extraction plan.

### What the Agent Does

When you ask: *"Generate a migration plan for this codebase"*

The agent follows the skill's decision table (row 1: "Generate a migration plan") and runs:

```bash
rgctl -r example/coolstore discover -l java \
  --with-cfg --with-harmonic --export-migration-hints \
  --migration-preset hybrid_default --migration-order scheduled
```

Then reads the plan:

```json
{
  "preset": "hybrid_default",
  "order_mode": "scheduled",
  "steps": [
    {
      "step": 1,
      "label": "com.redhat.coolstore.persistence",
      "priority_score": -0.17,
      "max_blast": 0.0
    },
    {
      "step": 2,
      "label": "com.redhat.coolstore.utils",
      "priority_score": 0.417,
      "max_blast": 0.0
    },
    {
      "step": 3,
      "label": "com.redhat.coolstore.rest",
      "priority_score": 0.329,
      "max_blast": 0.0
    }
  ]
}
```

The agent reports:

> The migration plan contains 5 scheduled steps using the hybrid_default preset (balanced weighting of PageRank, harmonic centrality, and blast radius). First extraction targets are low-coupling packages such as `com.redhat.coolstore.persistence`, then utilities and REST, before denser service/model communities.

### Investigating a Migration Step

When the user asks: *"Tell me more about the coolstore model community"*

The agent queries community members:

```bash
rgctl -r example/coolstore -f json communities list
rgctl -r example/coolstore -f json semantic query "coolstore model" --scope community --limit 20
rgctl -r example/coolstore -f json blast-radius getShoppingCart --depth 3
```

And checks blast radius on key functions (already shown above).
---

## Use Case: Porting a Function to Another Language

### Scenario

You are migrating `priceShoppingCart` from Java to Go (or TypeScript, Rust, Python, etc.) and need to ensure the new implementation preserves the same data flow and logic.

### What the Agent Does

**Step 1: Extract the structural blueprint from the source language.**

The agent captures the function's data-flow graph, which is language-independent:

```bash
rgctl -r example/coolstore -f json cpg flows \
  ./src/main/java/com/redhat/coolstore/service/ShoppingCartService.java \
  --line 68 --variable sc --function priceShoppingCart --direction forward
```

**Output:**

```json
{
  "direction": "forward",
  "function": "priceShoppingCart",
  "steps": [
    {"code": "for-each sc.getShoppingCartItemList()", "line": 64},
    {"code": "sc.setCartItemTotal(sc.getCartItemTotal() + sci.getPrice() * sci.getQuantity())", "line": 68},
    {"code": "ps.applyShippingPromotions(sc)", "line": 81},
    {"code": "sc.setCartTotal(sc.getCartItemTotal() + sc.getShippingTotal())", "line": 83}
  ],
  "reduction_percent": 66.67
}
```

**Step 2: Extract the call neighborhood.**

```bash
rgctl -r example/coolstore -f json cpg calls priceShoppingCart
```

This gives the agent the complete list of outgoing calls that the new implementation must replicate.

**Step 3: Extract field mutations.**

```bash
rgctl -r example/coolstore -f json cpg mutations \
  --type ShoppingCart --exclude-ctors
```

This lists every field that `priceShoppingCart` writes to, which the new implementation must also write.

**Step 4: Extract the PDG.**

```bash
rgctl -r example/coolstore -f json cpg pdg priceShoppingCart
```

**Output (truncated):**

```json
{
  "control_deps": 18,
  "data_deps": 5,
  "edges": [
    {"kind": "data", "source": "node_7", "target": "node_8", "variable": "sci"},
    {"kind": "data", "source": "node_7", "target": "node_8", "variable": "sc"},
    {"kind": "data", "source": "node_4", "target": "node_6", "variable": "sc"},
    {"kind": "control", "source": "node_1", "target": "node_5"}
  ]
}
```

**How the agent uses this:**

The agent now has four language-independent facts about `priceShoppingCart`:

1. **Data flow path**: iteration over cart items, accumulation of totals, shipping calculation, final total.
2. **Call contract**: the 7 functions it must call in the same order.
3. **Mutation contract**: the 5 ShoppingCart fields it must write.
4. **Dependency graph**: 18 control edges and 5 data edges encoding the computation structure.

When writing the Go implementation, the agent verifies each fact against the new code. If a data-flow step is missing, a call is omitted, or a field mutation is skipped, the agent flags it.

The agent can report: *"The Java implementation of priceShoppingCart has 4 data-flow steps, calls 7 functions, and mutates 5 fields on ShoppingCart. Your Go implementation should replicate the same iteration pattern (for-each over cart items), accumulate the same totals, and call equivalent functions for shipping calculation and promo application."*

---

## Use Case: Writing Better Test Cases

### Scenario

You need to write tests for `priceShoppingCart` and want to ensure you cover all branch paths and edge cases.

### What the Agent Does

**Step 1: Examine the control-flow graph.**

```bash
rgctl -r example/coolstore -f json inspect priceShoppingCart cfg
```

**Output (truncated):**

```json
{
  "edges": [
    {"kind": "next", "source": "block_5", "target": "block_7"},
    {"kind": "iftrue", "source": "block_7", "target": "block_8"},
    {"kind": "iffalse", "source": "block_7", "target": "block_1"},
    {"kind": "iftrue", "source": "block_9", "target": "block_10"},
    {"kind": "iffalse", "source": "block_9", "target": "block_3"},
    {"kind": "iftrue", "source": "block_12", "target": "block_13"},
    {"kind": "iffalse", "source": "block_12", "target": "block_14"},
    {"kind": "jump", "source": "block_13", "target": "block_12"},
    {"kind": "iftrue", "source": "block_15", "target": "block_16"},
    {"kind": "iffalse", "source": "block_15", "target": "block_0"}
  ]
}
```

The agent identifies all branch points:

> priceShoppingCart has 4 branch conditions:
> 1. Null check: `sc != null` (block_7) -- test with null and non-null input
> 2. List check: `sc.getShoppingCartItemList() != null && size > 0` (block_9/10) -- test with empty and populated cart
> 3. Loop: `for-each sci : sc.getShoppingCartItemList()` (block_12/13) -- test with 0, 1, and many items
> 4. Price threshold: `sc.getCartItemTotal() >= 25` (block_15) -- test below and above the threshold

**Step 2: Examine data dependencies.**

```bash
rgctl -r example/coolstore -f json inspect priceShoppingCart pdg --edge-layer data
```

The agent identifies the key data flows:

> Variable `sc` flows through 3 data-dependency edges. Variable `sci` flows through the loop body. Test cases should verify that each accumulation step (cartItemTotal, cartItemPromoSavings, shippingTotal) produces correct values.

**Step 3: Check field mutations to verify test assertions.**

```bash
rgctl -r example/coolstore -f json cpg mutations \
  --type ShoppingCart --exclude-ctors
```

The agent reports: *"Your tests should assert on 5 ShoppingCart fields after calling priceShoppingCart: cartItemTotal, shippingTotal, cartTotal, cartItemPromoSavings, and shippingPromoSavings. Here are the test cases derived from the CFG:"*

The agent can then generate concrete test cases:

1. **Null input**: call `priceShoppingCart(null)` -- no fields should be mutated.
2. **Empty cart**: cart with no items -- totals should be zero.
3. **Single item below threshold**: one item priced below 25 -- no shipping insurance.
4. **Single item above threshold**: one item priced at or above 25 -- shipping insurance applied.
5. **Multiple items with promotions**: verify promo savings accumulate correctly.
6. **Boundary case**: cart total exactly 25 -- verify threshold behavior.

## The NL-to-Command Decision Table

The skill embeds a decision table that maps natural-language patterns to CLI commands. Here are the key mappings:

| What You Ask the Agent | What the Agent Runs |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| "Generate a migration plan" | `discover . --with-cfg --with-harmonic --export-migration-hints` |
| "What are the bottlenecks?" | `metrics --pagerank` |
| "List all functions" | `find --type function --count-only` / `find --type function --limit 50` |
| "What communities exist?" | `communities list` |
| "Where is the checkout flow?" | `semantic index` then `semantic query "checkout flow"` |
| "What's the impact of changing X?" | `blast-radius X` |
| "Show the call stack around X" | `callers X --depth 3` / `callees X` |
| "Where is ShoppingCart mutated?" | `cpg mutations --type ShoppingCart` |
| "Trace variable X forward" | `cpg flows FILE --line N --variable X --direction forward` |
| "Validate against policies" | `check --policy-file policy.json` |

The agent handles disambiguation (e.g., adding `--class` or `--file` when a symbol name is ambiguous) and error recovery (e.g., running `discover --with-cfg` if slicing fails because CFG data is missing).

## Install options reference

```bash
rgctl [-r REPO] install [FLAGS]
```

You must pass at least one of **`--skill`** or **`--with-policy`**.

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| **`--skill`** | Install the single skill **`rgctl`** (with `references/`). |
| **`--with-policy`** | Structural bias snippet (e.g. `.cursor/rules/rgctl-structural.mdc`). Optional; does not replace skills. |
| **`--tools id1,id2`** or **`--tools all`** | Which **registry adapters** receive files. **Default (omit flag):** `cursor`, `claude`, `codex`, `agents`, `antigravity`. **`all`** = full registry (~40 products). Unknown ids: stderr warning; if none valid, exit **1**. |
| **`-g` / `--global`** | Install under your **home** (e.g. `~/.cursor/skills/…`) instead of repo-local paths. Only agents with `supports_global: true` (see `--list-agents`). |
| **`--list-agents`** | Print the registry table and exit (no install). |
| **`--force`** | Overwrite rgctl-managed files that differ from the bundled version. |
| **`--host`** | **Deprecated** — use **`--tools`**. |
| **`-f json`** | Schema version **3** install payload (`scope`, `agents`, per-write `kind` / `status`). |

### Typical installs

```bash
cd /path/to/your-app

# Skills for common IDEs (repo-local)
rgctl install --skill --tools cursor,claude,codex,antigravity,agents

# Cursor only
rgctl install --skill --tools cursor

# Skills + Cursor structural policy
rgctl install --skill --tools cursor --with-policy

# User-home install (adapters that support -g)
rgctl install --skill -g --tools cursor
```

Install does **not** run `discover`. Index separately (`rgctl discover .`), then query with `rgctl -f json …`.

### What gets written

Paths come from **`agent-pack/agents/registry.toml`**.

| Kind | Example (Cursor, repo-local) |
|------|------------------------------|
| Skill | `.cursor/skills/rgctl/SKILL.md` + `references/` |
| Policy | `.cursor/rules/rgctl-structural.mdc` (with `--with-policy`) |

**Shared dedup:** `codex`, `agents`, and `zed` share `.agents/skills/` — install writes each destination once. Run `rgctl install --list-agents` for the full adapter table.

### Scenarios inside the skill

Intent → CLI mappings live in the skill’s NL routing table and `references/workflows.md` (discover, impact, flow, search, migrate, gate, vuln). There are **no** separate `rgctl-*` skill directories — one skill covers all of them.

**Migrate** uses `--export-migration-hints` → `.rgctl/migration_plan.json` as the agent-facing migration deliverable.

## How the pack is distributed

At **rgctl build** time, `rgctl-agent-pack-codegen` generates the pack from `agent-pack/manifest.yaml`, `agent-pack/agents/registry.toml`, and `skills/rgctl/` (including `references/workflows.md`), then embeds it as a zip in the binary. This means:

- No network access needed to install.
- Pack version matches the CLI version.
- Upgrading `rgctl` and running `install --skill --force` refreshes skills.
- Target repos do not need a checkout of the rgctl source tree.

## Benefits

- **Zero-configuration AI integration.** One command installs everything the agent needs to understand your codebase structurally.
- **Natural-language interface.** Developers ask questions in English; the agent translates to CLI commands.
- **Language-independent analysis.** Data-flow graphs, call neighborhoods, and mutation tracking work across all 9 Tier 1 languages.
- **Refactoring safety net.** Blast radius, call tracing, and mutation analysis catch breaking changes before they ship.
- **Test case generation.** CFG branch analysis and data dependencies produce higher-coverage tests.
- **Migration guidance.** The agent can generate, explain, and walk through a complete migration roadmap.
- **Cross-language porting.** Data-flow and dependency graphs provide a structural blueprint that transcends language syntax.
- **Always in sync.** The skill is embedded in the binary, so it always matches the CLI version.
